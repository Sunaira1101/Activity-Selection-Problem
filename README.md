<h1 align="center"><bImplementation of Activity Selection Problem using Quick Sort algorithm with Greedy Approach</b></h1>

This project focuses on implementing the Activity Selection Problem using the Quick Sort algorithm alongside a Greedy Approach for optimal activity scheduling. By sorting activities based on their finish times using Quick Sort, the algorithm efficiently organizes the tasks in ascending order. Subsequently, the Greedy Approach selects activities greedily, ensuring compatibility by choosing the next available activity with the earliest finish time. This iterative selection process maximizes the number of tasks that can be completed without overlapping, ultimately providing an optimal solution to the Activity Selection Problem. The combination of Quick Sort and the Greedy Approach allows for a balance between computational efficiency and effective scheduling, making it a robust solution for activity management systems.
